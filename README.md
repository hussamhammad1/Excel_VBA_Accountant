# Hello there,


Before you use the content of this folder, I would like to introduce myself.

My name is ##Hussam Hammad.

I'm an undergraduate graduate from Carleton University (Address: 1125 Colonel By Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6).

I worked in serveral industries here in Canada including: Public Sector, Real Estate Management, Consultancy & Healthcare.


The purpose of this folder is to share my progress in my studies, and also to have it as a reference of what I'm able to do. 

Mainly it is going to be used for job hunting and getting feedback from experts in the field. 

As for the codes, it some collected/ wrote overtime while working (Used these codes in my previous jobs).

Without further ado, please send an e-mail if have a better way/ a room for improvement.

Enjoy your time on my page. :)

Detailed Explaination of each folder:
* > 01: Spreadsheets and macros I used in my professional career.
* > 02: Accounting University project to modify 3 accounting principles and 1 business strategy. We changed rent, asset depreciation and revenue recognition polcies.  For business, we opted to convert the cost of platforms to be open-sourced. We tried to project the next 3 years based on these changes.
* > 03: my simulated portfolio for my group during my academic years. We misplaced our intiaial files (investment philosophy, strategy and asset selection and allocation approach). philosophy: growth, strategy: 5 factors model adjusted for pricing correction (market, size, momentum, low-dividend & high-buybacks). 
* > 04: Our academic research about international diversification. Thesis: With the rise of internet, trades (trade blocs) and international consumption the value of diversification is diminishing. So, buying one of the futone 500 companies (with 35% revenues from overseas) is cheaper and optimal. 
* > 05: Cost of listing: which method of listing your company on the stock exchange provides the most value and the least risk. We looked at direct listing, traditional investment banking listing, and indirect (RTO /SPEC) listing.
* > 06: Various stock analysis (some are incomplete) 
* > 07: Final year project: find a unique company to analyze completely. present the finding and suggest multiple to overcome the current problems. We chose Fiesta Group Restaurant. Our findings were chocking and we placed 1st place in that semester.
